## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
Upvote and downvote comments
Bonus: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
